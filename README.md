# Registration & Login project
## Introduction
### Abstract:
Registration & Login is a project in which a person can login after registering in the database. Login details will be matched and get authenticated with the details present in the database.

#### What is Registration & Login?
When a person setup a new account in some website then they have to register and later get authenticated with the data they filled in the login page with the data present in the database. This whole process of registration and login is important for a person's security.

## Technologies Used
### Express.js
Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

### MongoDB
MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License which is deemed non-free by several distributions.

### Node.js
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications.

### Code Editor
#### VS Code
Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.

## Problem Statement & Solution
There can be data security problems if there is no Registration & Login process present in the websites or applications. Anyone will be able to change the data of some particular person. So to avoid these data security problems Registration & Login is made. When a person setup a new account in some website then they have to register and later get authenticated with the data they filled in the login page with the data present in the database. This whole process of registration and login is important for a person's security.

## Conclusion & Future Work
Registration & Login is made to avoid data security problems. Only the person who have the login details can see the data of that person, by this data security can be increased and our data becomes more secure. Various enhancements can be done to increse the data security.
